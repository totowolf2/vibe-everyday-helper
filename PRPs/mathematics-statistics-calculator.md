# PRP: Mathematics Category Implementation

## Overview

Implementation of a comprehensive mathematics category for the Everyday Helper Flutter app as specified in INIT.md. This feature will create the first calculation category with multiple mathematical programs including basic calculator, scientific calculator, statistics calculator, unit converter, and percentage calculator for daily use.

## Context

### Current State

- Home screen with category-based menu system using `HelperTool` models

### Requirements
From INIT.md:
- Create app that combines calculations into categories 
- Each category will have programs for calculating different things
- First category to implement: mathematics category
- UX/UI focused, easy to use and uniform layout
- Easy to improve and further develop
- Target platform: Android with Flutter framework

### Dependencies
Required packages to add to pubspec.yaml:

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
- **Division by zero**: Display "Cannot divide by zero" with clear icon, highlight problematic operation
- **Invalid expressions**: Show "Invalid expression" with specific error location highlighting
- **Non-numeric input in statistics**: Show "Please enter valid numbers separated by commas" with examples
- **Empty input fields**: Prompt user with contextual guidance and valid examples
- **Overflow errors**: Handle large number calculations gracefully with scientific notation
- **Parse errors**: Catch math_expressions parsing failures and show user-friendly messages with correction hints
- **Unit conversion errors**: Validate unit compatibility and show clear error messages with alternative suggestions
- **Memory constraints**: Implement calculation history limits with automatic cleanup
- **Network-dependent calculations**: Handle offline scenarios gracefully with local fallbacks

### Troubleshooting
- **Calculator not responding**: Check Provider state updates and widget rebuilds, implement debug logging
- **Incorrect calculations**: Verify math_expressions usage and operator precedence, add calculation validation
- **Statistics calculation errors**: Validate statistics package implementation and edge cases (empty sets, single values)
- **UI layout issues**: Test on different screen sizes and orientations, implement responsive breakpoints
- **Performance problems**: Profile widget rebuilds and optimize heavy calculations with debouncing
- **Navigation errors**: Ensure routes are properly registered in AppRoutes with error boundaries
